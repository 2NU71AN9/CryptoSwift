# Introduction
<p class="uk-dropcap">In functional programming, fold (also termed reduce, accumulate, aggregate, compress, or inject) refers to a family of higher-order functions that recursively combine elements of a data structure using a function.</p>

To In this article we're going to be focusing on loops that make use of an accumulation variable, for example:

- Sum of values
- Product of values
- Concatenation (sum of strings)

# Sum of Integer Values
We have an array of integers and need to return their combined sum.
